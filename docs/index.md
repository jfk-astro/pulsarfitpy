<!-- # pulsarfitpy

An Efficient Physics Informed Framework for Pulsar Analysis -->

# **Overview**

<!-- ## **Implementing 1D Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with pulsarfitpy** -->

pulsarfitpy is a tool intended to streamline analysis of  pulsars, a rapidly rotating neutron star. pulsarfitpy offers an intuitive PyTorch framework using [Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10561) to analyze differential equations in comparison to observed ATNF data. The application of the PINN framework provides an additional resource in pulsar analysis to test derived theoretical physics expressions and determine their validity.

pulsarfitpy offers the following features:  
- 1D PINN Support
- 2D PINN Support
- Python Library, Command Line Interface, and Graphical User Interface Options
