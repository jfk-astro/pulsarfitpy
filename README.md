# pulsarfitpy
> pulsarfitpy is a Python library that uses empirical data to approximate visualized polynomial functions for Neutron star parameters through the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) pulsar database and psrqpy.

## Installation
> Requirements: []
1. Clone the repository:
''' bash
git clone https://github.com/jfk-astro/pulsarfitpy.git
'''

2. 

## Usage
pulsarfitpy.poly_reg(str, str, int)
> accepts a x-param and y-param string that can be found in the [psrqpy paramters](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/psrcat_help.html?type=expert#par_list) 

> the integer decides to which order/degree will be searched up to for the data's best fit
